\section{Evaluation}

In order to evaluate the performance of SFQ($D^2$) and compare it with
other schedulers, we implemented SFQ(D) and set up a benchmark
environment in a single cluster node, which has a hyperthreaded
quad-core 2.4GHz Intel processor, 24GB of RAM, and a 120G SATA SSD. 

The first step was to benchmark the SSD to determine the optimal
device latency and the expected depth parameter.

\end{figure}

%% We
%% tested different schedulers in different IO-depth and workloads. The
%% figure 1 and 2 showed the total latency and bandwidth results that two
%% process which have the same intensive level run concurrent. The figure
%% 3 and 4 showed that the results of concurrent running intensive write
%% and sparse read.\\

%% Figure 1 and 2 showed that the latency and bandwidth of SFQ($D^2$) are
%% better than the IO-depth is 8 and 12. And the performance of
%% SFQ($D^2$) is the same noop scheduler.\\

%% Figure 3 and 4 showed that the latency and bandwidth of SFQ($D^2$) are
%% much better than any other schedulers, although the write operation
%% performance is degrade 20 percentage due to they are sharing the same
%% device. Compare with noop and SFQD, SFQ($D^2$) can keep the fairness
%% better than others.\\
