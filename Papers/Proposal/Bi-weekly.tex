\section{Bi-weekly schedule}

Due to the implementation works include SFQ, SFQ(D), FlashFQ and SFQ($D^2$), we schedule the bi-weekly scchedule as Table 1.\\

In order to develop the SFQ($D^2$), we need implement the basic SFQ algorithm and some features of FlashFQ IO scheduler. The new SFQ($D^2$) will work as an new IO scheduler which can profiling the parallism property and vary the IO depth based on the differences between observed and target performance. Finally, we need implement Flash FQ as an comparison to the new IO scheduler.
