\section{Current Status}

Due to we spent a lot of time on discussing the feasibility of this project, we just finish the SFQ($D^2$) design and begin the implement.\\
After fully understand the SFQ and FlashFQ papers, we list the points that we can improve. Compare with the FlashFQ, SFQ($D^2$) can control the IO depth according to the optimal parallelized of a flash device that profiled offline to archieve the fairness and performance goal.
